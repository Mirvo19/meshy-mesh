    /*
    This very simple function is what makes 3D graphics possible. :D
    the way it works is that it takes a 3D point and projects it onto a 2D plane.
    When you look around you, you are looking at a 2D projection of a 3D world.
    you mightve noticed how putting objects further away from you makes them smaller,
    from my own research they approximate to what we call a vanishing point, around (0,0)
    from any plane, that incldes our eyes.

    let us consider the distance from our eyes to the screen as f or focal length.
    our eyes are at )(0,0,0) and the screen is at S(0,0,f)
    let us assume a point P(x,y,z) and our eyes are looking at it.
    the vector joining our eyes to the point to the point is simply P-O. but,
    before reaching our eyes when the rays intersect the screen, they will intersect at a point 
    P'(x',y',f).
    The vector P-O represents a distance of D units; D=P-O
    now let us assume a line that slowly goes from P to O.
    the starting point would be Line=Point O, and the ending point would be initial point + the distance vector D
    .making us reach the point P.
    but assuming the line to a function we deduce that the line;
    L(t)=O+t*D where t is a small incremental value that goes from 0 to 1, and D is the distance vector.

    Now, finally: 
      When the point increments and reaches z=f;
      L(t)=O+t*D
      L(t)=(0,0,0)+t*(x,y,z) [hence; (x,y,z)-(0,0,0)=(x,y,z)]
      L(t)=(t*x,t*y,t*z)

      Since the line reaches (t*x,t*y,t*z) at z=f, we can say;
      L(t)=P'
      P'(x',y',f)=(t*x,t*y,t*z)
      
      Equating Corresponding components, we get;
      t*z=f
      t=f/z

      substituting t in the other components, we get;
      x'=t*x=(f/z)*x
      y'=t*y=(f/z)*y

      which is the final formula, but since we can assume f=1 units which can be whatever distance
      from user to screen, we can simplify it to;
        x'=x/z
        y'=y/z

        for further clarification, we can think of it like this. If our head is constantly in place then,
        the projection of the 3d object is accurate to scale of the this.canvas/screen/this and our eyes,
        the shape retains but we perceive it differently. human error is not inducive for perspective.

        a good analogy is;
          if we make a eye and want it to stare the user we make it look at (0,0)
          if the player moves to the right, the eye will still look at (0,0)
          but the player will perceive it as if the eye is looking at the left, that is the users fault
          not ours and doesnt need fixing!

  THIS is byfar the most complex part of this whole thing. since drawMesh is used in animations etc,
  and computing the vertices, edges and faces is a bit of a pain, i had to research on optimal ways to 
  do so. i found out that the best way to do it js not use the already defined functions (what happened
  to modularity bruh) and manually do all the arithmetic with each call.

  but to better understand drawMesh i should explain the workflow with the predefined functions.

   let POINT be a 3d point (x,y,z)
    perform transformation on it. rotation translation are mainly included
    cameraTransform() just subtracts everything rendering from our current camera position for relativity
    project() turns the 3d point into a drawable shape via (x*f/z,f*y/z)
    cartesianGrapher(POINT) turns it from a [-1,1] grapth to a [0,w] graph
   which is then, and ONLY then drawn into the canvas with point, or if 2 points line or 4 points face
   u get the idea

   drawMesh just does all of this stuff inline. if for any reason u wanna build from my shitty class
   the workflow is above.
